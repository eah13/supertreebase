The original supertreebase (http://github.com/rvosa/supertreebase) is (amongst other things) a dump 
of essentially all phylogenetic trees in TreeBASE (treebase.org) in NeXML and other formats, provided 
by Rutger Vos (http://github.com/rvosa).  I have forked it so that I can modify & alter them for testing 
for the MIAPA-ETL project (http://github.com/miapa/miapa-etl).  I'm also trimming out some of the non-XML 
files for ease of navigation and syncing.


 - IF YOU NEED PHYLOGENETIC DATA PLEASE DO NOT USE THESE FILES - 


They may be modified to generate tricky, but valid, NeXML test cases and so should be used for coding only.

I'll update this readme with an orientation to files as I get further along.  I'll comment within each modified file as well, so if you're interested in funky NeXML files in the meantime, watch the commits.
